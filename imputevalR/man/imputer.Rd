\title{Run Imputation Procedure and Generate Imputed Datasets}
\usage{
imputer(df, nchains = 5, niter = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame for which imputed data sets should be generated}

\item{nchains}{The number of chains (ie number of imputed datasets) to generate}

\item{niter}{The number of iterations to complete in each chain (default is 100 for convergence)}
}
\value{
A list (\code{returnSets}) that contains 5 imputed data.frames with missing values
that were originally in df with imputed values based on the predicted imputed values
}
\description{
Takes in a data.frame with missing values, and runs the imputation algorithm
to return 5 imputed data sets (stored as a list) with missing values replaced
by imputed values.
}
\examples{
data(nhanes)
miss_data <- imputevalR::makeNA(nhanes, proportionNA = 0.2)
imputed <- imputer(miss_data, nchains = 1, niter = 5)

}
